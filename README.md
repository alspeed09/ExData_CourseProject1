#### Exploratory Data Analysis: Course Project 1 ####

Here you can see the 4 constructed plots. Separated png files were added to this repository along with one script for each plot. Since I'm originally from a spanish speaking country, my computer system put the dates in spanish:

* Jue. = Jueves (spanish) = Thursday
* Vie. = Viernes (spanish) = Friday
* Sab. = SÃ¡bado (spanish) = Saturday
